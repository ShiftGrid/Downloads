Automation of everything and everyone has become a cardinal direction in the development of society, in which the value of human life is not disputed. The role of a person in a fully automated environment comes down to the realization of creative potential, moral improvement, expansion and deepening of knowledge about the laws of the universe. Based on such ideas, we approach the process of extracting profit from fluctuations in the exchange rate of market assets as a type of activity that can easily be automated, and we strive to exclude as much as possible human intervention from this activity, which is inevitably associated with making mistakes and miscalculations caused by emotions, lack of time, distraction, fatigue and other factors inherent in humans and completely absent from the mechanism. We are constructing an certain algorithm based on the most fundamental laws of the market (namely, its fundamental unpredictability and cyclicality), and implement it in the form of software suitable for effective profit-making, which, after setting up and putting into operation, no longer requires any control actions from side of the human operator.
